When using a multilingual TYPO3 website with a single page tree, the page with
the default language can be disabled. By default, this is only visible in the
page properties where this can be adjusted. This extension displays a hint on
the backend page itself to make editors aware of this setting:

.. figure:: /Images/example.png
   :alt: Display information that the default language of a page is deactivated
   :class: with-shadow

   Display information that the default language of a page is deactivated

Release management
==================

This extension uses `semantic versioning`_ which basically means for you, that

*  Bugfix updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 1.0.1) just includes small bug fixes or
   security relevant stuff without breaking changes.
*  Minor updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 1.1.0) includes new features and smaller
   tasks without breaking changes.
*  Major updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 2.0.0) breaking changes which can be
   refactorings, features or bug fixes.

The changes between the different versions can be found in the
:ref:`changelog <changelog>`.
